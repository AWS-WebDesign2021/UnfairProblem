<h3>
  Academic Interests and My Experience at Annie Wright Schools
</h3>
    <p>
      I have attended Annie Wright Schools
      for 13 years and I absolutely love it.
      Not only are the teachers passionate
      about teaching their students, but they
      also care for everyone in the AWS community.
      Another aspect that I love about the school
      is the opportunities and community. Annie Wright
      is a diverse and accomodating place for
      everyone of different ethnicities, interests,
      religions, and gender. Not only do they accept
      each student and help them become better people
      through their teaching and understanding of the world,
      they help them explore their personal passions
      and find interests in different areas in which
      they might have overlooked. With the
      opportunities Annie Wright has
      to offer, I'm able to learn new topics
      with a more deeper understanding of the
      hows and whys. Although I love all of my
      classes, my favorite classes are:
    </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Computer Science</li>
        <br>
        <li>Chemistry</li>
        <br>
        <li>History</li>
      </ol>

<h3>
  My Passions
</h3>

<p>
  Although I am very focused on my academic studies, I am very passionate about the arts.
  I play multiple instruments, write songs, am a member of the Tacoma Youth Symphony,
  do theatre and musical theatre both in and out of the school, and I sing. Some of the instruments I play are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Piano</li>
  <li>Violin</li>
  <li>Ukulele</li>
  <li>Guitar</li>
</ul>

  Here is a picture taken at the school's production of Much Ado About Nothing where I played Beatrice.
