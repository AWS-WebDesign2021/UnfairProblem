  <h2><left>Introduction</left></h2>
  <p>Hyacinth Macaws, also known as Andorhynchus Hyacinthinus, are stunning blue and yellow parrots. These birds<br>
    are known to be a meter in length, have a mass of 2.6-3.7 lbs, and can live up to 50 years old in the wild. Although this species<br>
    is large in size and mass, the estimated population of this macaw has decreased over many decades. With the organization<br>
    of foundations dedicated to the preservation of this beautiful creature, it has been proven successful in keeping these animals alive.<br>
    Now, there are more than double the amount of Hyacinth Macaws in the world since the 1980s.</p>

  <br>

  <h2>Regions</h2>
  <p>The hyacinth macaw is mostly located in Central and South America.
    The biggest regions where these<br>parrots can be found are in:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Brazil</li>
      <li>Bolivia</li>
      <li>Paraguay</li>
    </ol>
  <p>Since these macaws are completely dependent on fruits, seeds, and nuts,
    their main habitat is the South American tropical<br>rainforest, where many wildlife
    resides.</p>


  <h2>Make A Difference</h2>
  <p>Since the realization of the total population of these unique macaws
    (an estimate of 450 total in the 1980s),<br>
    many organizations were founded in order to create a difference
    and repopulate the world with these beautiful<br>creatures. Luckily,
    these efforts were successful, and by the 2000s there were more
    than 3000 Hyacinth Macaws in<br>the world. Although not as populous as
    they were centuries prior, the macaw has made a comeback and will hopefully
    <br>continue to grow its numbers. If you want to join one of these
    organizations or was to find out more ways to donate, go to the<br>following
