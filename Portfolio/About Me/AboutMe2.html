        Academic Interests and My Experience at Annie Wright Schools
      </h3>
      <p>
        I have attended Annie Wright Schools
        for 13 years and I absolutely love it.
        Not only are the teachers passionate
        about teaching their students, but they
        also care for everyone in the AWS community.
        Another aspect that I love about the school
        is the opportunities and community. Annie Wright
        is a diverse and accomodating place for
        everyone of different ethnicities, interests,
        religions, and gender. Not only do they accept
        each student and help them become better people
        through their teaching and understanding of the world,
        they help them explore their personal passions
        and find interests in different areas in which
        they might have overlooked. With the
        opportunities Annie Wright has
        to offer, I'm able to learn new topics
        with a more deeper understanding of the
        hows and whys. Although I love all of my
        classes, my favorite classes are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Computer Science</li>
        <br>
        <li>Chemistry</li>
        <br>
        <li>History</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <h3>
        My Passions
      </h3>
        <p>
          Although I am very focused on my academic studies, I am very passionate about the arts.
          I play multiple instruments, write songs, am a member of the Tacoma Youth Symphony,
          do theatre and musical theatre both in and out of the school, and I sing. Some of the instruments I play are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Piano</li>
          <li>Violin</li>
          <li>Ukulele</li>
          <li>Guitar</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Here is a picture taken at the school's production of Much Ado About Nothing where I played Beatrice.
