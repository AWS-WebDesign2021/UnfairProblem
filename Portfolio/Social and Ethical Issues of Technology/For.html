  <p2><b>The Benefits of Anonymity</b></p2>
  <p>Anonymity is a social issue that has been questioned since the beginning
    of the development of internet presence. As technology increases,
    the more customer usage and information is consumed from all age groups.
    From the drastic increment of usage over the past 2 decades, many argue
    over the importance and value of anonymity. Anonymity is the condition of being
    anonymous, specifically in an online presence. With the increment in usage of social media,
    parents worry over their child's mental health, social media presence, and
    how much access they have to information. This can be especially
    stressful to parents who are still learning how to manage technology
    and other forms of media. Without having a proper basis of
    knowledge over the topic, it becomes difficult to manage a child's
    intake of the quantity and quality of information. With the benefit of anonymity,
    kids, teens, and adults are able to express their creativity, opinions, and beliefs
    without having the constant fear of judgement, bullyiing, and many other repercussions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Freedom of speech and expression</li>
    <li>Less judgement</li>
    <li>Less fear of surveillance</li>
    <li>Produces more creativity</li>
    <li>Protection of privacy for everyone</li>

    <p>In this TedTalk, creator of previous app 'After School', Michael
      Callahan talks about his experience and inspiration in creating a space
      where teens can seek help for emotional trauma anonymously. The app
      was very successful until discontinued in 2019 due to filtering issues.</p>
