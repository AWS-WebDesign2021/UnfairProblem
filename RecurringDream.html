    Soaring above the trees, a giant orange pyterodactyl looks down on the land.
    Although he had been hunted by other, greater, dinosaurs, he considered this his home.
    Life was peaceful flying above the trees, watching the sunrise and set each day as
    the wind gently grazed its wings.
    The sunset painted the sky with oranges and yellows and were soon to be followed with dark
    blues, and stars and moons that would light up the sky. As the lights began to appear, he
    charted his course for home; Smiling at another day of life. Little did he know, this
    peaceful day would be interupted by chaos and terror, that would be known as his
    final moments of life.
