    <p2><b>Background</b></p2>
    <p>The internet is being used for countless purposes on infinite websites and apps,
      by billions of people worldwide. For <br> many reasons, 86% of internet users have
      made at least some kind of attempt to make themselves somewhat anonymous<br> when
      they are online. Anonymity, in the sense of online users, is “any interaction
      a user has on the Internet that protects <br> his or her identity from being
      shared with another user or with a third party.” Depending on the intentions
      of the <br>anonymous user and the reason they want to stay anonymous, this tool
      can be incredibly helpful and incredibly harmful <br>depending on how it is used.
      From organizing protests and becoming part of an online community to cyberbullying
      and <br>scams, these pages will highlight the main pros and cons of online anonymity.</p>
